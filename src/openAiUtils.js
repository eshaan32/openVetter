// given a prompt. Have to pass the prompt in to Chat GPT and vet the prompt by GPT's prompt engineering standards


// Designing a prompt vetter for OpenAI's GPT models, including GPT-4, involves several steps. The primary objective is to ingest a user's prompt, analyze it, and provide feedback based on the prompt engineering guidelines established by OpenAI. Here's a general outline of how you might approach this:

// User Prompt Ingestion:

// Create a user interface where users can input their prompts. This could be a simple text area in a web or mobile app.
// Ensure you have a method to capture and store these inputs for analysis.
// Analysis Against Guidelines:

// Develop a set of rules or heuristics based on OpenAI's prompt engineering guidelines. This might include checks for clarity, specificity, inclusion of context, and division of complex tasks into simpler subtasks.
// Write algorithms or scripts to analyze the prompts against these rules. For example, you could check for the presence of certain keywords, the complexity of sentences, or the overall structure of the prompt.
// Feedback Generation:

// Based on the analysis, generate feedback for the user. This could include suggestions on how to rephrase the prompt for better clarity, add more context, or break down complex requests.
// Feedback could be presented in a user-friendly format, such as a list of suggestions or an annotated version of the original prompt.
// Utilizing GPT API for Vet:

// For more advanced analysis, you might consider using the GPT API itself to vet prompts. This could involve sending the user's prompt to the API and analyzing the response for coherence, relevance, and adherence to the guidelines.
// A more sophisticated approach could involve developing a meta-prompt for GPT, where you ask GPT to analyze the user's prompt based on specific criteria derived from the guidelines.
// Iterative Testing and Refinement:

// Continuously test the prompt vetter with a wide range of prompts to ensure its effectiveness.
// Refine your analysis algorithms and feedback mechanisms based on user feedback and performance.
// Integration with GPT API:

// Make sure your system is properly integrated with the GPT API, adhering to OpenAI's usage policies and rate limits.
// Handle the API responses efficiently and securely, especially if you are processing sensitive or personal user data.
// User Interface and Experience:

// Design a user-friendly interface for your prompt vetter. Ensure it's intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions on how to input prompts and interpret feedback.
// Consider adding features like saving previous prompts, allowing users to compare their original and revised prompts, or providing examples of well-constructed prompts.
// Legal and Ethical Considerations:

// Be mindful of legal and ethical considerations, especially regarding data privacy and user consent. Make sure to comply with relevant data protection regulations.
